In these baselines, we adopt the library LDPC decoding function of MATLAB, i.e., "hDec = comm.LDPCDecoder(ldpcPropertyValuePairs{:})", for a fast simulation.  However, it is implemented in C, while others are all implemented in MATLAB. 

Therefore, for fariness of latency comparison, we should change the decoding function into the one implemented by MATLAB, i.e., "ldpc_decode_SPA", which is also provided in the folder named "Functions" for your convenience.
